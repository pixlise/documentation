# UI Layout

The UI repository layout is in the style of a standard Angular application.

Inside the client/src/app directory are a number of components. These are written in a combination of html, sass based style sheets and typescript code.

The assets folder contains images for use in the application.

The environments folder contains a number of environment definitions for local development and deployment in production.
